PICO SulTeng COVID-19 API Documentation
Deployment prepared on: $(date)
Built with: Vue.js + Vite
Target: Hostinger Shared Hosting

Deployment Structure:
- All files in this directory should be uploaded to public_html/
- .htaccess handles Vue Router routing and API proxy
- api-down.html is the maintenance page for API downtime

Post-deployment steps:
1. Ensure .htaccess is in the document root
2. Verify Vue router is working by testing routes
3. Test API proxy functionality
4. Check that all assets load correctly
